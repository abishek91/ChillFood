 * I like the concept - I would use it! However, it does seem very dependent on a large data set of recipes to create meaningful interactions. How are you planning to gather that data? Also, the data interactions on the server side that you described are fairly simple - perhaps instead of requiring all ingredients for a recipe, you could implement some sort of partial match algorithm.

 * Although this seems like a cool and useful project, it seems like you will need much larger dataset in order for it to work as afully functional webapp (larger number of recipes, videos, etc). I would also recommend thinking a bit harder about the use case of the project - if students have 3 ingredients in the fridge, what can they realistically make? What recipes would show up for them, if at all? As of right now, I think you would need some more features that set this app apart from just a recipe website. Some ideas might be to include geolocation, where you can see if friends are close to you, and then you can combine your ingredients to make a recipe, etc. Brainstorm other APIs that might be useful for your use cases.

 * This sounds like an adequately scoped project for 2 people. I like the idea of being able to list the ingredients you have and the app returning the list of all possible meals that can be made. For instructional videos, you could have video uploading and playback as a capability. You'll want to consider storage options like Amazon S3. In addition to this, you'll definitely want to use a database that is NOT SQLite. We'll get into Postgres later in the semester and that might be a lot more appropriate.
